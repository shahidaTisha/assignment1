    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div class = "Introduction">
      <p>Monstera deliciosa, the Swiss cheese plant or split-leaf philodendron is a species of flowering plant native to tropical forests of southern Mexico, south to Panama. It has been introduced to many tropical areas, and has become a mildly invasive species in Hawaii, Seychelles, Ascension Island and the Society Islands. It is very widely grown in temperate zones as a houseplant.The common name "Swiss cheese plant" is also used for the related species from the same genus, Monstera adansonii. The common name "split-leaf philodendron" is also used for the species Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum, although neither species are in the genus Philodendron.

    <h3>About</h3>
    <div class = "About">
        <p>This member of the arum family (Araceae) is a hemiepiphyte[10] with aerial roots. It is able to grow up to 20 m (66 ft) high in the wild, with large, leathery, glossy, pinnate, heart-shaped leaves 25–90 cm (10–35.5 in) long by 25–75 cm (10–29.5 in) broad. The leaves on young plants are smaller and entire with no lobes or holes, but soon produce lobed and fenestrate leaves as they grow.[11][12] Although it can grow very tall in nature, it only measures between 2 and 3 m (6.6 and 9.8 ft) when grown indoors. The older the plant, the more the leaves are covered with its familiar large perforations.</p>
